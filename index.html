  <p>This is an almost minimal command-based live coding engine. Press the button to re-evaluate your code.
    This language allows you to specify a rhythmic pattern of beats by entering a space-separated list of times and pitches. 
    You can also include javascript computation in the values.
    As an example:
  </p>
  <p>1+1@220 2@220*2 1*3@270</p>

  You can also specify gain, attack, and release values. Gain values are also separated by the @ symbol,
  while attack and release should be comma-separated. For example:

  <p>1+1@220@0.5 2@220*2,1,0.4 1*3@270</p>
